# Hospital-Readmission-Dashboard-Analysis
Interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing factors influencing hospital readmission rates across disability populations using U.S. Census Bureau data

## Project Overview
This project analyzes factors influencing hospital readmission rates to help healthcare organizations avoid penalties from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for excessive readmissions. The analysis combines patient medical data with U.S. Census Bureau S1810 Disability Characteristics to provide insights on how disability types and demographic factors impact readmission trends.

## Dashboard Features
- Interactive visualization of readmission rates by state, disability type, and age group
- Comparison of initial hospitalization duration between readmitted and non-readmitted patients
- Population segment analysis across different disability categories
- Colorblind-friendly design with high-contrast visualizations
- Mobile-optimized interface

## Key Findings
- Patients with shorter initial hospitalizations (17 days average) showed higher readmission rates compared to those with longer stays (64 days average)
- Significant state-level variations in readmission rates exist for the same disability types
- Initial hospitalization durations for identical disability types varied by 1-2 weeks between states
- Top performing states (lowest readmission rates): New Hampshire (25.38%), Delaware (28.24%), Arizona (28.32%)
- States with highest readmission rates: South Carolina (45.77%), Connecticut (43.40%), Georgia (41.61%)

## Recommendations
The analysis provided targeted recommendations for different stakeholders:
- **Hospital Operations**: Invest in targeted research and interventions for prevalent disabilities
- **Research Teams**: Investigate correlation between initial hospitalization duration and readmission rates
- **Regional Management**: Implement region-specific initiatives in states with higher readmission rates

## Tools Used
- Tableau Public for interactive dashboard development
- U.S. Census Bureau S1810 Disability Characteristics dataset
- Medical patient data with readmission outcomes

## Dashboard Access
The interactive dashboard is available on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rancel.hernandez/viz/D210_presentation/D10_assessment?publish=yes)
